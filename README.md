  Nunjucks Components
</h1>

> **New Release** — This component library is freshly published. If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wernerglinka/nunjucks-components/issues). This library provides components for both the [Metalsmith](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-structured-content-starter) and [Eleventy](https://github.com/wernerglinka/eleventy-structured-content-starter) structured content starters.

A reference implementation and documentation site for building component-based static sites with Metalsmith and Eleventy. The library contains 61 production-ready components (23 partials, 38 sections) that use structured content in frontmatter rather than Markdown body content. Each component manages its own template, styles, and scripts, which are automatically bundled only when used on pages.

This library provides the component catalog for both the [Metalsmith2025 Structured Content Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-structured-content-starter) and the [Eleventy Structured Content Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/eleventy-structured-content-starter). All components are compatible with both starters' architecture and can be integrated into projects using the automated packaging system.

### Technical Implementation

The build system implements several architectural patterns for optimal performance:

- **Component Dependency Bundling**: Dedicated plugins for each SSG (`metalsmith-bundled-components` or `eleventy-plugin-components-bundler`) scan all pages and bundle only CSS/JS for components actually used, creating single site-wide optimized files
- **PostCSS Processing**: Automatic autoprefixing, stylelint validation, and cssnano minification for all component styles
- **Component Encapsulation**: Each component contains its own `.njk` template, `.css` styles, `.js` scripts, and `manifest.json` with dependencies and JSON Schema validation
- **Zero Runtime Dependencies**: Outputs pure HTML/CSS/JS without framework overhead (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Build-Time Search Indexing**: Search plugins generate unified search index from 200+ entries across pages, sections, and structured content
- **JSON Data Architecture**: External data files provide clean separation between content and configuration for maps, podcasts, blurbs, and collections
- **Component Packaging**: Automated ZIP package generation during production builds with install scripts for easy distribution
- **46 Nunjucks Filters**: Custom template filters across 8 categories (string, date, markdown, array, debug, validation, object)
- **Static Asset Handling**: Uses Metalsmith 2.7.0's native `statik` method for pass-through copying of images, audio, icons, and lotties from `src/assets/` without loading them into memory. Bundler inputs (CSS/JS entry points) remain in `lib/assets/` for processing

## Using This Library

### For Starter Users (Metalsmith or Eleventy)

To integrate components from this library into projects built with either the [Metalsmith2025 Structured Content Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-structured-content-starter) or the [Eleventy Structured Content Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/eleventy-structured-content-starter):

1. Browse the live site or source code to identify needed components
2. Download component packages from production builds (available in `build/downloads/`)
3. Run the included install script to copy component files to your project's components directory
4. Add component dependencies to your project if not already present
5. Use components in page frontmatter by specifying `sectionType` in the sections array

Both starters use identical component architecture, so components work interchangeably between Metalsmith and Eleventy projects.

### As a Reference Implementation

This repository demonstrates production-ready patterns for component-based static site generation with Metalsmith and Eleventy. Developers can examine the source code to understand:

- Structured content architecture using YAML frontmatter
- Component dependency management with manifest.json files
- Build-time asset bundling and optimization
- JSON data integration patterns for complex components
- Testing strategies for components and build pipelines

### Forking for Custom Libraries

The repository can be forked to create organization-specific or theme-specific component libraries:

1. Fork the repository and clone locally
2. Remove existing components or keep as reference examples
3. Develop new components following the manifest.json structure
4. Add documentation pages in `src/references/sections/` or `src/references/partials/` for each component
5. Deploy to hosting service for team access

## Architecture

### Relationship with Starter Projects

This library demonstrates the same structured content paradigm used by both the [Metalsmith2025 Structured Content Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith2025-structured-content-starter) and the [Eleventy Structured Content Starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/eleventy-structured-content-starter). Each starter provides the foundation and build system for component-based sites, while this library provides a catalog of production-ready components that integrate with both systems.

All three projects share:

- Component architecture with manifest.json dependency tracking
- Structured frontmatter approach instead of Markdown body content
- Automatic component bundling for asset optimization (metalsmith-bundled-components or eleventy-plugin-components-bundler)
- Nunjucks template engine with custom filters
- JSON Schema validation in component manifests

### Structured Content Approach

Instead of traditional Markdown files with content in the body, this system uses structured data in frontmatter to define pages:

```yaml
---
layout: pages/sections.njk
sections:
  - sectionType: hero
    text:
      title: 'Welcome to Nunjucks Components'
      prose: 'Build modern websites with reusable components'
    containerFields:
      background:
        image: '/assets/images/hero.jpg'
  - sectionType: media-image
    text:
      title: 'Feature Showcase'
      prose: 'Combine text and images seamlessly'
    image:
      src: '/assets/images/feature.jpg'
      alt: 'Feature demonstration'
---
```

### Component Structure

Each component is self-contained in its own directory with required and optional files:

**Required Files**:

- `component-name.njk` - Nunjucks template defining HTML structure
- `manifest.json` - Component metadata with dependency declarations and JSON Schema validation

**Optional Files**:

- `component-name.css` - Component-specific styles (bundled only when component is used)
- `component-name.js` - Interactive behavior (bundled only when component is used)
- `component-name.yml` - Example frontmatter configuration for documentation
- `README.md` - Component documentation

**Manifest Structure**:

```json
{
  "name": "component-name",
  "type": "section",
  "styles": ["component-name.css"],
  "scripts": ["component-name.js"],
  "requires": ["text", "ctas", "commons"],
  "validation": {
    "required": ["sectionType"],
    "properties": {}
  }
}
```

**Advanced: Multi-Provider Components**:
Components supporting multiple libraries (maps with Leaflet/OpenLayers, podcast with RSS parsing) use the `modules` field in manifest.json to organize provider implementations and shared utilities in a `modules/` subdirectory.

### Dependency Bundling System

Both `metalsmith-bundled-components` and `eleventy-plugin-components-bundler` implement build-time asset optimization using the same approach:

1. Scans all pages site-wide to identify which components are used
2. Bundles CSS/JS only for components actually present on pages
3. Creates single optimized files (main.css, main.js) shared across all pages
4. Applies PostCSS processing (autoprefixer, cssnano) to bundled CSS
5. Uses esbuild for JavaScript bundling with tree-shaking

Result: Minimal bundle sizes with optimal browser caching since all pages share the same asset files.

### JSON Data Architecture

Complex components use external JSON files in `lib/data/` for data management:

**Data Organization**:

- `lib/data/maps/` - Map marker data (3 files: London, Paris, NYC clustering demo)
- `lib/data/podcasts/` - RSS feed configurations (4 podcast shows)
- `lib/data/blurbs/` - Content blurbs (2 files with grid configurations)
- Root data files: site.json, author.json, socialLinks.json, faqs.json, etc.

**Benefits**:

- Clean separation of UI configuration (frontmatter) from content data (JSON)
- Scalable for large datasets without cluttering page files
- Reusable across multiple pages
- Recursive directory loading makes all data accessible as `data.filename` or `data.subdirectory.filename`

**Filtering**:
Use the `getSelections` Nunjucks filter to display subsets:

```yaml
items:
  source: 'maps.london-landmarks'
  scope: 'selections'
  selections: ['tower-bridge', 'big-ben']
```
