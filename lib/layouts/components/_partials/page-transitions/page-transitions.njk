{#
  Page Transitions Partial

  This partial has no visual output. It loads the SWUP page transition
  library and component registry via its manifest.json scripts/styles.

  Include this partial in your layout to enable smooth page transitions.
  Components inside the SWUP container will automatically re-initialize
  after each transition if they register with window.PageTransitions.

  Usage in layout:
  {% include "components/_partials/page-transitions/page-transitions.njk" %}
#}
